You can call this theme in two ways:

  The first method contains all additional images and font as base64-encoded data-urls.
* <https://blog.fefe.de/?css=http(s)://yourhosting.domain/edfefecss/edfefe.css><br>
  The second method includes all additional images and font from separate files.

The used font is called monofur and is free. see <www.dafont.com/monofur.font> (Jan 12 2014)
